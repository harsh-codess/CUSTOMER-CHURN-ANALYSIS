Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting customer churn. I design a custom deep learning model, train it on a dataset, and use it to make predictions on whether a customer is likely to leave.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling)

Building a custom ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras

Training the model with train-test split

Evaluating model performance using accuracy and loss metrics

Making predictions on new customer data

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy & Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn
